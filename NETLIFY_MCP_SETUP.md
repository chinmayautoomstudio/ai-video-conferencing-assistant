# ðŸš€ Netlify MCP Server Setup Guide

## âœ… **MCP Configuration Added**

I can see you've successfully added the Netlify MCP server to your Cursor configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@playwright/mcp@latest"
      ]
    },
    "Netlify": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@netlify/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## ðŸ”§ **Next Steps to Complete Setup**

### **Step 1: Get Your Netlify API Token**

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard**: [https://app.netlify.com/](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. **Click on your profile** (top right corner)
3. **Go to "User settings"**
4. **Click "Applications"** in the left sidebar
5. **Click "Personal access tokens"**
6. **Click "New access token"**
7. **Give it a name**: `AI Video Conference Assistant`
8. **Click "Generate token"**
9. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)

### **Step 2: Set Environment Variable**

**For Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Set the environment variable for current session
$env:NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN = "your_netlify_token_here"

# Or set it permanently (requires admin)
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN", "your_netlify_token_here", "User")
```

**For Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
# Set the environment variable for current session
set NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN=your_netlify_token_here

# Or set it permanently
setx NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN "your_netlify_token_here"
```

### **Step 3: Restart Cursor**

1. **Close Cursor completely**
2. **Reopen Cursor**
3. **Open your project**

### **Step 4: Verify MCP Server is Working**

After restarting, you should be able to use Netlify MCP commands like:
- List your sites
- Check deployment status
- View build logs
- Manage environment variables

## ðŸŽ¯ **What You'll Be Able to Do**

Once the Netlify MCP server is properly configured, you'll be able to:

### **Deployment Management:**
- âœ… **Check deployment status** in real-time
- âœ… **View build logs** directly in Cursor
- âœ… **Trigger new deployments** from Cursor
- âœ… **Monitor build progress** live

### **Site Management:**
- âœ… **List all your Netlify sites**
- âœ… **Check site status** and configuration
- âœ… **View site analytics** and performance
- âœ… **Manage site settings**

### **Environment Variables:**
- âœ… **View current environment variables**
- âœ… **Add/update environment variables**
- âœ… **Verify Supabase credentials** are set correctly

### **Build Management:**
- âœ… **Monitor build process** in real-time
- âœ… **Debug build failures** with detailed logs
- âœ… **Check build performance** and optimization

## ðŸ§ª **Testing the Setup**

After completing the setup, you can test by:

1. **Opening a new chat** in Cursor
2. **Asking**: "Check my Netlify sites"
3. **Expected**: You should see a list of your Netlify sites
4. **If it works**: The MCP server is properly configured!

## ðŸ”§ **Troubleshooting**

### **If MCP server doesn't work:**

1. **Check environment variable**:
   ```powershell
   echo $env:NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

2. **Verify token is valid**:
   - Go to Netlify dashboard
   - Check if the token is active

3. **Restart Cursor**:
   - Close completely
   - Reopen and try again

4. **Check Cursor logs**:
   - Look for MCP server connection errors
   - Verify the server is loading

### **Common Issues:**

- **Token not set**: Make sure `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable is set
- **Token expired**: Generate a new token if the old one expired
- **Cursor not restarted**: MCP servers only load on startup
- **Network issues**: Check your internet connection

## ðŸŽ‰ **Benefits of Netlify MCP Integration**

### **Real-Time Monitoring:**
- âœ… **Live deployment status** updates
- âœ… **Build progress** monitoring
- âœ… **Error detection** and debugging
- âœ… **Performance insights**

### **Streamlined Workflow:**
- âœ… **No need to switch** between Cursor and Netlify dashboard
- âœ… **Direct integration** with your development environment
- âœ… **Automated monitoring** of your deployments
- âœ… **Quick access** to all Netlify features

## ðŸ“‹ **Next Steps**

1. **Get your Netlify API token** from the dashboard
2. **Set the environment variable** in your system
3. **Restart Cursor** to load the MCP server
4. **Test the integration** by checking your sites
5. **Monitor your deployment** with real-time updates

**Once set up, you'll have powerful Netlify integration directly in Cursor!** ðŸš€
